INTRODUCTION                                           *nvim-unception*

    A plugin that leverages Neovim's native |clientserver| feature to
make opening files from within Neovim's terminal emulator without experiencing
weird behavior easier and completely automatic.

    Terminal buffers will no longer enter a state of "inception" in which an
instance of Neovim is open within an instance of Neovim. Instead, the desired
files and directories will be opened by the "host" Neovim session, which
leverages |:argadd| to update its own arguments.

SETTINGS                                               *nvim-unception-settings*

    IMPORTANT: These settings must be accessible to the Neovim instance that
is launched within a terminal buffer. What this means is that you cannot set
them in the Neovim server session alone after it is already running. They must
be set sometime during initialization before the client loads the plugin (e.g.
they can be placed in your init.vim file).

*g:unception_delete_replaced_buffer*                     bool (default=false)

        When true, causes nvim-unception to delete the buffer under the cursor
    when the command from the Neovim session that was launched within the
    terminal buffer is received.

        Note: This should virtually always be the terminal buffer that was
    used to launch the new Neovim session, but there are no guarantees in
    place that mandate that this will be the case.


*g:unception_open_buffer_in_new_tab*                     bool (default=false)

        When true, causes the server Neovim session to open files/directories
    in a new tab rather than placing them in the current buffer.


*g:unception_disable*                                    bool (default=false)

        When true, prevents nvim-unception from changing any default behavior.
