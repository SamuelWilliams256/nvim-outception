bool                                       *g:unception_delete_replaced_buffer*

    When true, causes nvim-unception to delete the buffer under the cursor
when the command from the Neovim session that was launched within the terminal
buffer is received.

    Note: This should virtually always be the terminal buffer that was used to
launch the new Neovim session, but there are no guarantees in place that
mandate that this will be the case.


bool                                       *g:unception_open_buffer_in_new_tab*

    When true, causes the server Neovim session to open file/directory in a
new tab rather than placing it in the current buffer.
