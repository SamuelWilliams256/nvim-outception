INTRODUCTION                                           *nvim-unception*

        A plugin that leverages Neovim's native |clientserver| feature to make
    opening files from within Neovim's terminal emulator without experiencing
    weird behavior easier and completely automatic.

        Terminal buffers will no longer enter a state of "inception" in which
    an instance of Neovim is open within an instance of Neovim. Instead, the
    desired files and directories will be opened by the "host" Neovim session,
    which leverages |:argadd| to update its own arguments.

SETTINGS                                               *nvim-unception-settings*

        IMPORTANT: These settings must be accessible to the Neovim instance
    that is launched within a terminal buffer. What this means is that you
    cannot set them in the Neovim server session alone after it is already
    running. They must be set sometime during initialization, before the
    nested session loads the plugin.

        To put it simply, these settings can be placed in your initialization
    files (e.g. init.vim), but will not work if directly calling |:let| in the
    server session after the server is already running.

*g:unception_delete_replaced_buffer*                     bool (default=false)

        When true, causes the Neovim session running the local server to
    delete the buffer under the cursor when a command is received from a
    Neovim client session (i.e. a session launched from within a terminal
    buffer).

        Has no effect when |g:unception_open_buffer_in_new_tab| is true.

        Note: The deleted buffer should always be the terminal buffer that was
    used to launch the new Neovim session, but there are no checks in place
    that mandate that this will always be the case. If the cursor was somehow
    moved quickly enough to another buffer between the time the client sends
    the command and the server receives it, this could technically cause
    deletion of the wrong buffer.


*g:unception_open_buffer_in_new_tab*                     bool (default=false)

        When true, causes the server Neovim session to open files/directories
    in a new tab rather than placing them in the window that has focus.


*g:unception_enable_flavor_text*                         bool (default=true)

        When true, causes unception to echo a message whenever it is
    triggered.


*g:unception_disable*                                    bool (default=false)

        When true, disables nvim-unception.
